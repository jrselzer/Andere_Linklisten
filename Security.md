# Vulnerability Scanners
* [OpenVAS](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/openvas) OpenVAS, an application used to scan endpoints and web applications to identify and detect vulnerabilities. It is commonly used by corporations as part of their mitigation solutions to quickly identify any gaps in their production or even development servers or applications.
