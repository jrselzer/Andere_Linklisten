* [Thomas Edison 1922](https://muninn.net/thoughts/edison-predictions/) “I believe that the motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks. I should say that on the average we get about two percent efficiency out of schoolbooks as they are written today. The education of the future, as I see it, will be conducted through the medium of the motion picture…where it should be possible to obtain one hundred percent efficiency.”
